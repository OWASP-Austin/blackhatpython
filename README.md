# blackhatpython
OWASP study group working through the Black Hat Python book: https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython

There are a few preparations prior to starting this book, rather than install dependencies as you go. 
I prefer to use VMwarefusion VMs on NAT mode rather than my host machiene.
Note we had trouble with arper.py on Virtual Box, and I recommend using VMwarefusion. 

Install a Kali Linux VM:
  With a secondary user, and text editor with python packages
  
Install a Windows VM: with python
